# Ghahe-SLID

## What is this repo?

This repo is for snow leopard individual identification work in Ghahe. We plan to make the whole process a automatic, reproducible, and assignable work, and promote this workflow to all future wildlife ID projects.

## What is our mission?

The core concept is to switch "individual-based matching" to "detection-based matching". Instead of deciding if this picture is **Ind1** or **Ind2**, we should simply decide if the **individual in detection1** is the same as the **individual in detection2**. This will finally result in a up-triangular matrix.

Switching the matching object makes the ID work assignable. Researchers only need to match detection, and the minimal working unit is a pair of 2 detection. So the work could be assigned to as many people as possible, each person only need to work with a few pairs. Aggregating all results and make each matching assigned to at least 2 people will lead to confident results.
